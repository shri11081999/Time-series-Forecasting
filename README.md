# Forecasting Future Pricing Trends with Time Series Analysis: A BHEL Case Study

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting future values of BHEL material code pricing indices using time series forecasting methods, particularly ARIMA models. Developed during my internship at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), this project demonstrates the application of time series analysis in a practical, industrial context.

## Project Scope

The project aims to predict future pricing trends based on historical data. It involves:

* Analyzing past pricing indices of BHEL material codes.

* Applying the ARIMA model to forecast future prices.

* Visualizing the predictions and comparing them with actual data.
## Key Features

* Time series forecasting using ARIMA model.

* Visualization of predicted vs. actual data.

* Calculation of percentage error between predictions and actual data.
## Technology Used

* **Programming Language**: Python

* **Libraries** : pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, pmdarima

* **Tools** : Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
## Dataset Prepration

* The dataset is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly due to industry confidentiality.

## Installation

* Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/shri11081999/Time-series-Forecasting.git
```
## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries.

2. Load the dataset containing BHEL material code pricing indices.

3. Apply the ARIMA model to forecast future values.

4. Visualize the results and analyze the performance of the model.
## Results

The ARIMA model was applied to predict the pricing indices for the years 2023 and 2024. The key results include:

* **Prediction Accuracy**:  The ARIMA model (0,1,0) achieved an Absolute Percentage Error of 0.90%, indicating a high level of accuracy in the predictions.

* **Overall Trend**: The model successfully captured the overall trend in the pricing indices, allowing for reliable forecasting.

* **Performance**: The model's performance was validated by comparing the predicted values with actual historical data, showing a close alignment.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of time series forecasting in predicting BHEL material code pricing trends and provide valuable insights for strategic planning.
